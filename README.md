 A ride sharing app heavily inspired by Uber. The user can see which driver is closest to the current location.

They can also search for their destination, and the app will auto suggest the closest matching locations.

When the user has selected their desired location, the app will show them the optimal route.

After visualizing the entire route, the user can chose a payment method and then confirm the ride.

After all is said and done, the app will display a real time duration untill the driver will pick up the user.

As i mentioned earlier, this app is heavily inspired by Uber, trying to be as faithful to the original as possible.
